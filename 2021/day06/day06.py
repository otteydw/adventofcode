    The version that used the LanternFish class worked for part 1 but was not efficient for part 2 (256 days).

    I went online for some advice and found this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJjpXJm7x0o

    It seems the most efficient method for doing this would need to not care about each individual fish, but instead the
    frequency of each fish' starting timer.

    I rewrote my function to remove the LaternFish class, somewhat based on code from
    https://github.com/womogenes/AoC-2021-Solutions/blob/main/day_06/day_06_p1.py
